This is a fork of samac's package for some quality of life enhancements.

Original package: https://github.com/samaks/simple_html_dom

**Note:** There is a revamped package from voku which improves the library a lot, but where the API has changed:

https://github.com/voku/simple_html_dom

This package adds the following things:

  * Entirely backwards compatible
  * Possibility to access error messages when loading a file or string fails
  * Possibility to set the maximum file size setting after loading
